# dictionary_site
This repository carries the code for the dictionary site. <br>
<br>
This site was created in November 2022 as an experiment by me to understand how search engine databases work.<br>
Feel free to fork this and use it for whatever you want.

## Frontend
The frontend has 2 pages. Both are created using HTML, CSS and Javascript, no framework has been used.

## Backend
Backend has been created using: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Python v3.10</li>
    <li>FastAPI v0.86</li>
    <li>Meilisearch v0.29</li>
    <li>Uvicorn v0.19</li>
</ul>

## Some notes
<ul>
    <li>Please note that this project doesn't follow the best coding or security standards, as it was experimental and I also had less experience back then.</li>
